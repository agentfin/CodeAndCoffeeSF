This is the sandbox project #CodeAndCoffeeSF.

The idea here is to try out new skills and get them 
up on the web to share and be seen.

This will also be a kind of history of how the internet
has changed. From simple HTML and a bit of CSS, through 
to Javascript and then on to Ruby… 

We're scaffolded with RoR. 
We're hosted on Heroku <3
